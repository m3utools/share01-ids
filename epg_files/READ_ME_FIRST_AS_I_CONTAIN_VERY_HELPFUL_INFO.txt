.pdf & .txt files contain EPG IDs for the .xml.gz file of the same name.

Example:

	epg_ripper_ALL_SOURCES1.pdf
	epg_ripper_ALL_SOURCES1.txt

	These 2 files above contain the same data.
	They contain a list of IDs for EPG data that is in the file below.

	epg_ripper_ALL_SOURCES1.xml.gz 

	Each file will contain data for different countries or different tv/streaming services.

	For example:

		epg_ripper_US1.xml.gz

		This file contains EPG data for USA channels.

	Here is a website that you can use to match a country name with it's 2 character ISO code:

		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes

Tips:
	*I recommend using the .pdf files.
	Sometimes the .txt files have characters that do not display/copy/paste correctly.

	*The ALL .xml.gz file is very large once it is downloaded and extracted.
	Some devices may not have enough memory to handle it.

Enjoy! :)
